# Citysub

A toy programming language that supports multiple bounded quantification mechanisms.

The syntax is based on the [supplementary implementations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/resources.html#checkers) for _Types and Programming Languages_. There is also a [MoonBit port](https://github.com/pku-dppl/TAPL-in-MoonBit).
